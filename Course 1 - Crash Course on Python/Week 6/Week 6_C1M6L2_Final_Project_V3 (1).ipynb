This script needs to process the text, remove punctuation, ignore case and words that do not contain all alphabets, count the frequencies, and ignore uninteresting or irrelevant words.  A dictionary is the output of the `calculate_frequencies` function.  The `wordcloud` module will then generate the image from your dictionary."

You could see what word clouds you can get from famous books, like a Shakespeare play or a novel by Jane Austen. Save this as a .txt file somewhere on your computer.\n",

    "\n",
    "As I conceive it to be the duty of every rational creature to attend to\n",
    "its offspring, I am sorry to observe, that reason and duty together have\n",
    "not so powerful an influence over human conduct, as instinct has in the\n",
    "brute creation. Indolence, and a thoughtless disregard of every thing,\n",
    "except the present indulgence, make many mothers, who may have momentary\n",
    "starts of tenderness, neglect their children. They follow a pleasing\n",
    "impulse, and never reflect that reason should cultivate and govern those\n",
    "instincts which are implanted in us to render the path of duty\n",
    "pleasant—for if they are not governed they will run wild; and strengthen\n",
    "the passions which are ever endeavouring to obtain dominion—I mean\n",
    "vanity and self-love.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to be attended to, is laying the foundation of a good\n",
    "constitution. The mother (if there are not very weighty reasons to\n",
    "prevent her) ought to suckle her children. Her milk is their proper\n",
    "nutriment, and for some time is quite sufficient. Were a regular mode of\n",
    "suckling adopted, it would be far from being a laborious task. Children,\n",
    "who are left to the care of ignorant nurses, have their stomachs\n",
    "overloaded with improper food, which turns acid, and renders them very\n",
    "uncomfortable. We should be particularly careful to guard them in their\n",
    "infant state from bodily pain; as their minds can then afford them no\n",
    "amusement to alleviate it. The first years of a child’s life are\n",
    "frequently made miserable through negligence or ignorance. Their\n",
    "complaints are mostly in their stomach or bowels; and these complaints\n",
    "generally arise from the quality and quantity of their food.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suckling of a child also excites the warmest glow of tenderness—Its\n",
    "dependant, helpless state produces an affection, which may properly be\n",
    "termed maternal. I have even felt it, when I have seen a mother perform\n",
    "that office; and am of opinion, that maternal tenderness arises quite as\n",
    "much from habit as instinct. It is possible, I am convinced, to acquire\n",
    "the affection of a parent for an adopted child; it is necessary,\n",
    "therefore, for a mother to perform the office of one, in order to\n",
    "produce in herself a rational affection for her offspring.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children very early contract the manners of those about them. It is easy\n",
    "to distinguish the child of a well-bred person, if it is not left\n",
    "entirely to the nurse’s care. These women are of course ignorant, and to\n",
    "keep a child quiet for the moment, they humour all its little caprices.\n",
    "Very soon does it begin to be perverse, and eager to be gratified in\n",
    "every thing. The usual mode of acting is complying with the humours\n",
    "sometimes, and contradicting them at others—just according to the\n",
    "dictates of an uncorrected temper. This the infant finds out earlier\n",
    "than can be imagined, and it gives rise to an affection devoid of\n",
    "respect. Uniformity of conduct is the only feasible method of creating\n",
    "both. An inflexible adherence to any rule that has been laid down makes\n",
    "children comfortable, and saves the mother and nurse much trouble, as\n",
    "they will not often contest, if they have not once conquered. They will,\n",
    "I am sure, love and respect a person who treats them properly, if some\n",
    "one else does not indiscreetly indulge them. I once heard a judicious\n",
    "father say, “He would treat his child as he would his horse: first\n",
    "convince it he was its master, and then its friend.” But yet a rigid\n",
    "style of behaviour is by no means to be adopted; on the contrary, I wish\n",
    "to remark, that it is only in the years of childhood that the happiness\n",
    "of a human being depends entirely on others—and to embitter those years\n",
    "by needless restraint is cruel. To conciliate affection, affection must\n",
    "be shown, and little proofs of it ought always to be given—let them not\n",
    "appear weaknesses, and they will sink deep into the young mind, and call\n",
    "forth its most amiable propensities. The turbulent passions may be kept\n",
    "down till reason begins to dawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the nursery too, they are taught to speak; and there they not only\n",
    "hear nonsense, but that nonsense retailed out in such silly, affected\n",
    "tones as must disgust;—yet these are the tones which the child first\n",
    "imitates, and its innocent playful manner renders them tolerable, if not\n",
    "pleasing; but afterwards they are not easily got the better of—nay, many\n",
    "women always retain the pretty prattle of the nursery, and do not forget\n",
    "to lisp, when they have learnt to languish.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children are taught revenge and lies in their very cradles. If they fall\n",
    "down, or strike their heads against any thing, to quiet them they are\n",
    "bid return the injury, and their little hands held out to do it. When\n",
    "they cry, or are troublesome, the cat or dog is chastised, or some\n",
    "bugbear called to take them away; which only terrifies them at first,\n",
    "for they soon find out that the nurse means nothing by these dreadful\n",
    "threatenings. Indeed, so well do they discover the fallacy, that I have\n",
    "seen little creatures, who could scarcely speak, play over the same\n",
    "tricks with their doll or the cat.\n",
    "\n",
    "How, then, when the mind comes under discipline, can precepts of truth\n",
    "be inforced, when the first examples they have had would lead them to\n",
    "practice the contrary?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "                           MORAL DISCIPLINE.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been asserted, “That no being, merely human, could properly\n",
    "educate a child.” I entirely coincide with this author; but though\n",
    "perfection cannot be attained, and unforeseen events will ever govern\n",
    "human conduct, yet still it is our duty to lay down some rule to\n",
    "regulate our actions by, and to adhere to it, as consistently as our\n",
    "infirmities will permit. To be able to follow Mr. Locke’s system (and\n",
    "this may be said of almost all treatises on education) the parents must\n",
    "have subdued their own passions, which is not often the case in any\n",
    "considerable degree.\n",
    "\n",
    "The marriage state is too often a state of discord; it does not always\n",
    "happen that both parents are rational, and the weakest have it in their\n",
    "power to do most mischief.\n",
    "\n",
    "How then are the tender minds of children to be cultivated?—Mamma is\n",
    "only anxious that they should love her best, and perhaps takes pains to\n",
    "sow those seeds, which have produced such luxuriant weeds in her own\n",
    "mind. Or, what still more frequently occurs, the children are at first\n",
    "made play-things of, and when their tempers have been spoiled by\n",
    "indiscreet indulgence, they become troublesome, and are mostly left with\n",
    "servants; the first notions they imbibe, therefore, are mean and vulgar.\n",
    "They are taught cunning, the wisdom of that class of people, and a love\n",
    "of truth, the foundation of virtue, is soon obliterated from their\n",
    "minds. It is, in my opinion, a well-proved fact, that principles of\n",
    "truth are innate. Without reasoning we assent to many truths; we feel\n",
    "their force, and artful sophistry can only blunt those feelings which\n",
    "nature has implanted in us as instinctive guards to virtue.\n",
    "Dissimulation and cunning will soon drive all other good qualities\n",
    "before them, and deprive the mind of that beautiful simplicity, which\n",
    "can never be too much cherished.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed it is of the utmost consequence to make a child artless, or to\n",
    "speak with more propriety, not to teach them to be otherwise; and in\n",
    "order to do so we must keep them out of the way of bad examples. Art is\n",
    "almost always practiced by servants, and the same methods which children\n",
    "observe them to use, to shield themselves from blame, they will\n",
    "adopt—and cunning is so nearly allied to falsehood, that it will\n",
    "infallibly lead to it—or some foolish prevaricating subterfuge will\n",
    "occur; to silence any reproaches of the mind which may arise, if an\n",
    "attention to truth has been inculcated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another cause or source of art is injudicious correction. Accidents or\n",
    "giddy tricks are too frequently punished, and if children can conceal\n",
    "these, they will, to avoid chastisement. Restrain them, therefore, but\n",
    "never correct them without a very sufficient cause; such as a violation\n",
    "of truth, cruelty to animals, inferiors, or those kind of follies which\n",
    "lead to vice.\n",
    "\n",
    "Children should be permitted to enter into conversation; but it requires\n",
    "great discernment to find out such subjects as will gradually improve\n",
    "them. Animals are the first objects which catch their attention; and I\n",
    "think little stories about them would not only amuse but instruct at the\n",
    "same time, and have the best effect in forming the temper and\n",
    "cultivating the good dispositions of the heart. There are many little\n",
    "books which have this tendency. One in particular I recollect: The\n",
    "Perambulations of a Mouse. I cannot here help mentioning a book of\n",
    "hymns, in measured prose, written by the ingenious author of many other\n",
    "proper lessons for children. These hymns, I imagine, would contribute to\n",
    "fill the heart with religious sentiments and affections; and, if I may\n",
    "be allowed the expression, make the Deity obvious to the senses. The\n",
    "understanding, however, should not be overloaded any more than the\n",
    "stomach. Intellectual improvements, like the growth and formation of the\n",
    "body, must be gradual—yet there is no reason why the mind should lie\n",
    "fallow, while its “frail tenement” is imperceptibly fitting itself for a\n",
    "more reasonable inhabitant. It will not lie fallow; promiscuous seeds\n",
    "will be sown by accident, and they will shoot up with the wheat, and\n",
    "perhaps never be eradicated.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever a child asks a question, it should always have a reasonable\n",
    "answer given it. Its little passions should be engaged. They are mostly\n",
    "fond of stories, and proper ones would improve them even while they are\n",
    "amused. Instead of these, their heads are filled with improbable tales,\n",
    "and superstitious accounts of invisible beings, which breed strange\n",
    "prejudices and vain fears in their minds.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lisp of the nursery is confirmed, and vulgar phrases are acquired;\n",
    "which children, if possible, should never hear. To be able to express\n",
    "the thoughts with facility and propriety, is of great consequence in\n",
    "life, and if children were never led astray in this particular, it would\n",
    "prevent much trouble.\n",
    "\n",
    "The riot too of the kitchen, or any other place where children are left\n",
    "only with servants, makes the decent restraint of the parlour irksome. A\n",
    "girl, who has vivacity, soon grows a romp; and if there are male\n",
    "servants, they go out a walking with them, and will frequently take\n",
    "little freedoms with Miss, the bearing with which gives a forwardness to\n",
    "her air, and makes her pert. The becoming modesty, which being\n",
    "accustomed to converse with superiors, will give a girl, is entirely\n",
    "done away. I must own, I am quite charmed when I see a sweet young\n",
    "creature, shrinking as it were from observation, and listening rather\n",
    "than talking. It is possible a girl may have this manner without having\n",
    "a very good understanding. If it should be so, this diffidence prevents\n",
    "her from being troublesome.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the duty of a parent to preserve a child from receiving wrong\n",
    "impressions.—As to prejudices, the first notions we have deserve that\n",
    "name; for it is not till we begin to waver in our opinions, that we\n",
    "exert our reason to examine them—and then, if they are received, they\n",
    "may be called our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first things, then, that children ought to be encouraged to observe,\n",
    "are a strict adherence to truth; a proper submission to superiors; and\n",
    "condescension to inferiors. These are the main articles; but there are\n",
    "many others, which compared to them are trivial, and yet are of\n",
    "importance. It is not pleasing to see a child full of bows and grimaces;\n",
    "yet they need not be suffered to be rude. They should be employed, and\n",
    "such fables and tales may be culled out for them as would excite their\n",
    "curiosity. A taste for the beauties of nature should be very early\n",
    "cultivated: many things, with respect to the vegetable and animal world,\n",
    "may be explained in an amusing way; and this is an innocent source of\n",
    "pleasure within every one’s reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, try to teach them to combine their ideas. It is of more use\n",
    "than can be conceived, for a child to learn to compare things that are\n",
    "similar in some respects, and different in others. I wish them to be\n",
    "taught to think—thinking, indeed, is a severe exercise, and exercise of\n",
    "either mind or body will not at first be entered on, but with a view to\n",
    "pleasure. Not that I would have them make long reflections; for when\n",
    "they do not arise from experience, they are mostly absurd.\n",

    "                       EXTERIOR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Under this head may be ranked all those accomplishments which merely\n",
    "render the person attractive; and those half-learnt ones which do not\n",
    "improve the mind. “A little learning of any kind is a dangerous thing;”\n",
    "and so far from making a person pleasing, it has the contrary effect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Parents have mostly some weighty business in hand, which they make a\n",
    "pretext to themselves for neglecting the arduous task of educating their\n",
    "children; they are therefore sent to school, and the allowance for them\n",
    "is so low, that the person who undertakes the charge must have more than\n",
    "she can possibly attend to; of course, the mechanical parts of education\n",
    "can only be observed. I have known children who could repeat things in\n",
    "the order they learnt them, that were quite at a loss when put out of\n",
    "the beaten track. If the understanding is not exercised, the memory will\n",
    "be employed to little purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "Girls learn something of music, drawing, and geography; but they do not\n",
    "know enough to engage their attention, and render it an employment of\n",
    "the mind. If they can play over a few tunes to their acquaintance, and\n",
    "have a drawing or two (half done by the master) to hang up in their\n",
    "rooms, they imagine themselves artists for the rest of their lives. It\n",
    "is not the being able to execute a trifling landscape, or any thing of\n",
    "the kind, that is of consequence—These are at best but trifles, and the\n",
    "foolish, indiscriminate praises which are bestowed on them only produce\n",
    "vanity. But what is really of no importance, when considered in this\n",
    "light, becomes of the utmost, when a girl has a fondness for the art,\n",
    "and a desire of excellence. Whatever tends to make a person in some\n",
    "measure independent of the senses, is a prop to virtue. Amusing\n",
    "employments must first occupy the mind; and as an attention to moral\n",
    "duties leads to piety, so whoever weighs one subject will turn to\n",
    "others, and new ideas will rush into the mind. The faculties will be\n",
    "exercised, and not suffered to sleep, which will give a variety to the\n",
    "character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dancing and elegance of manners are very pleasing, if too great a stress\n",
    "is not laid on them. These acquirements catch the senses, and open the\n",
    "way to the heart; but unsupported by solid good qualities, their reign\n",
    "is short.\n",
    "\n",
    "The lively thoughtlessness of youth makes every young creature agreeable\n",
    "for the time; but when those years are flown, and sense is not\n",
    "substituted in the stead of vivacity, the follies of youth are acted\n",
    "over, and they never consider, that the things which please in their\n",
    "proper season, disgust out of it. It is very absurd to see a woman,\n",
    "whose brow time has marked with wrinkles, aping the manners of a girl in\n",
    "her teens.\n",
    "\n",
    "I do not think it foreign to the present subject to mention the trifling\n",
    "conversations women are mostly fond of. In general, they are prone to\n",
    "ridicule. As they lay the greatest stress on manners, the most\n",
    "respectable characters will not escape its lash, if deficient in this\n",
    "article. Ridicule has been, with some people, the boasted test of\n",
    "truth—if so, our sex ought to make wonderful improvements; but I am apt\n",
    "to think, they often exert this talent till they lose all perception of\n",
    "it themselves. Affectation, and not ignorance, is the fair game for\n",
    "ridicule; and even affectation some good-natured persons will spare. We\n",
    "should never give pain without a design to amend.\n",

    "\n",
    "It may be thought, that artificial manners and exterior accomplishments\n",
    "are much the same; but I think the former take a far wider range, and\n",
    "are materially different. The one arises from affectation, and the other\n",
    "seems only an error in judgment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The emotions of the mind often appear conspicuous in the countenance and\n",
    "manner. These emotions, when they arise from sensibility and virtue, are\n",

    "countenance, than to cultivate the virtues which animate and improve it.\n",
    "\n",
    "How many people are like whitened sepulchres, and careful only about\n",
    "appearances! yet if we are too anxious to gain the approbation of the\n",
    "world, we must often forfeit our own.\n",
    "\n",
    "How bewitching is that humble softness of manners which humility gives\n",
    "birth to, and how faint are the imitations of affectation! That\n",
    "gentleness of behaviour, which makes us courteous to all, and that\n",
    "benevolence, which makes us loth to offend any, and studious to please\n",
    "every creature, is sometimes copied by the polite; but how aukward is\n",
    "the copy! The warmest professions of regard are prostituted on all\n",
    "occasions. No distinctions are made, and the esteem which is only due to\n",
    "merit, appears to be lavished on all—Nay, affection is affected; at\n",
    "least, the language is borrowed, when there is no glow of it in the\n",
    "heart. Civility is due to all, but regard or admiration should never be\n",
    "expressed when it is not felt.\n",

    "affected. She is not solicitous to act a part; her endeavour is not to\n",
    "hide; but correct her failings, and her face has of course that beauty,\n",
    "which an attention to the mind only gives. I never knew a person really\n",
    "ugly, who was not foolish or vicious; and I have seen the most beautiful\n",

    "Feeling is ridiculous when affected; and even when felt, ought not to be\n",
    "displayed. It will appear if genuine; but when pushed forward to notice,\n",

    "\n",
    "The management of servants is a great part of the employment of a\n",

    "them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Servants are, in general, ignorant and cunning; we must consider their\n",
    "characters, if we would treat them properly, and continually practise\n",
    "forbearance. The same methods we use with children may be adopted with\n",
    "regard to them. Act uniformly, and never find fault without a just\n",
    "cause; and when there is, be positive, but not angry. A mind that is not\n",
    "too much engrossed by trifles, will not be discomposed by every little\n",
    "domestic disaster; and a thinking person can very readily make allowance\n",
    "for those faults which arise from want of reflection and education. I\n",
    "have seen the peace of a whole family disturbed by some trivial, cross\n",
    "accident, and hours spent in useless upbraidings about some mistake\n",
    "which would never have been thought of, but for the consequences that\n",
    "arose from it. An error in judgment or an accident should not be\n",
    "severely reprehended. It is a proof of wisdom to profit by experience,\n",
    "and not lament irremediable evils.\n",
    "\n",
    "A benevolent person must ever wish to see those around them comfortable,\n",
    "and try to be the cause of that comfort. The wide difference which\n",
    "education makes, I should suppose, would prevent familiarity in the way\n",
    "of equality; yet kindness must be shewn, if we are desirous that our\n",
    "domestics should be attached to our interest and persons. How pleasing\n",
    "it is to be attended with a smile of willingness, to be consulted when\n",
    "they are at a loss, and looked up to as a friend and benefactor when\n",
    "they are in distress. It is true we may often meet with ingratitude, but\n",
    "it ought not to discourage us; the refreshing showers of heaven\n",
    "fertilize the fields of the unworthy, as well as the just. We should\n",
    "nurse them in illness, and our superior judgment in those matters would\n",
    "often alleviate their pains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, we owe them a good example. The ceremonials of religion, on\n",
    "their account, should be attended to; as they always reverence them to a\n",
    "superstitious degree, or else neglect them. We should not shock the\n",
